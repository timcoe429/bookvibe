# BookVibe Project Document

## Project Overview
BookVibe is an AI-powered book recommendation app that suggests books based on user mood. The app uses photo analysis to detect books from bookshelf images and provides personalized reading recommendations.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18, Modern CSS with gradients and animations
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Sequelize ORM
- **Deployment**: Railway with Docker
- **APIs**: Google Vision API, Goodreads API, Google Books API, Open Library API
- **AI Vision**: Google Cloud Vision API for book spine text recognition

## Recent Work (Latest Updates - December 2024)

### âœ… COMPLETED

#### 1. **Modern UI Design Overhaul**
   - Completely redesigned app with contemporary gradients and animations
   - Beautiful floating book cards with glassmorphism effects
   - Smooth micro-interactions and hover effects
   - Modern typography with Inter font family
   - Fixed navigation overlap issues (proper bottom padding)
   - Enhanced mobile responsiveness

#### 2. **Book Discovery Animation System**
   - Created engaging book reference journey steps
   - Randomized selection from 22+ famous book references
   - Improved timing: 4 steps total, 2 seconds each (8 seconds total)
   - Added references from Harry Potter, LOTR, Project Hail Mary, The Book of Doors, Dune, etc.
   - Fixed grammar issues (e.g., "Climbing Mount Doom" not "mountain of Mordor")

#### 3. **Google Vision AI Integration**
   - Set up Google Cloud service account for Vision API
   - Created service-account.json with proper credentials
   - Configured environment variables for Railway deployment
   - Built comprehensive photo upload system with error handling
   - Added fallback recommendations when API calls fail

#### 4. **PhotoUpload Component**
   - Fixed JavaScript errors (map() on undefined)
   - Added drag-and-drop image upload functionality
   - Camera integration for taking photos
   - Progress indicators during upload and AI processing
   - Book selection interface with checkboxes
   - Proper error handling and user feedback

#### 5. **Navigation & State Management**
   - Fixed "Library" tab to show user's book collection
   - Fixed "Add Books" tab to open photo upload modal
   - Proper state reset when switching between tabs
   - Clean modal overlays with modern design

#### 6. **Backend API Structure**
   - Photo upload endpoints (/api/photos/upload)
   - Book confirmation endpoints (/api/photos/confirm-books)
   - Upload info and tips endpoint (/api/photos/upload-info)
   - Google Vision service integration
   - Book matching service for title recognition

### ðŸ”§ CURRENT STATUS: AI Detection Setup

#### **Issue**: "Resource not found" error when uploading photos
**Root Cause**: Missing Google Cloud environment variables on Railway deployment
**Solution**: Need to add environment variables to Railway dashboard

#### **Required Environment Variables for Railway**:
```env
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=./config/service-account.json
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=production
CLIENT_URL=https://bookvibe-production.up.railway.app
```

#### **Service Account JSON**: Already created and ready to deploy
- Project ID: book-finder-466923
- Service account: bookvibe-vision-api@book-finder-466923.iam.gserviceaccount.com
- Permissions: Basic Editor (includes Vision API access)

### ðŸ“‹ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS
1. **Add environment variables to Railway dashboard**
2. **Upload service account JSON to Railway deployment**
3. **Test AI book detection functionality**
4. **Verify end-to-end photo â†’ AI â†’ library workflow**

### ðŸŽ¯ FEATURES WORKING
âœ… **Beautiful modern UI** with animations and gradients
âœ… **Book mood recommendation system** with sample books
âœ… **Navigation between Home/Library/Add Books**
âœ… **PhotoUpload component** with drag-drop and camera
âœ… **Error handling and user feedback**
âœ… **Railway deployment** serving frontend and backend

### ðŸš§ FEATURES IN PROGRESS
ðŸ”§ **AI book detection** - backend ready, needs Railway env vars
ðŸ”§ **User library persistence** - needs database integration
ðŸ”§ **Book covers and metadata** - needs API integration

## Important Notes
- **RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT ONLY** - No local development
- Modern glassmorphism design with smooth animations
- Google Vision API configured for book spine text recognition
- Railway automatically handles PORT environment variable
- Frontend calls relative URLs (/api/*) in production

## Current Database Schema
- Users table (basic user management)
- Books table (book metadata)
- UserBooks table (user's personal library)
- Supports PostgreSQL with Sequelize ORM

## API Endpoints
- `GET /api/books/recommendations?mood=romance&limit=3` - Get mood-based recommendations
- `POST /api/photos/upload` - Upload photo for AI book detection
- `POST /api/photos/confirm-books` - Confirm and add detected books to library
- `GET /api/photos/upload-info` - Get photo tips and recommendations
- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint

## Current Priority
ðŸš€ **IMMEDIATE**: Fix Railway environment variables to enable AI book detection
ðŸ“š **NEXT**: Test full AI workflow (photo â†’ detection â†’ library)
ðŸŽ¨ **FUTURE**: Add book covers, ratings, and enhanced metadata
